# Project-1-ND

# Motivation
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on winedataset usng CRIPS-DM process. 

# Prerequisites

# Project Summary
Here we are trying to derive some insights from our dataset just by using EDA. We will try to answer the following questions:
-How does the data look?
-What kind of story that each of our data tells?
-What are other interesting relationships that can be derived from exploring the data?


# Summary
Some of the insights from EDA:
- Alcohol % has the strongest positive correlation with quality, citric acid has the strongest negative correlation
- Type and concentration of acid can impact quality of wine 
- Our data has skewness with the exception of pH and density
