# Exploratory Data Analysis for Wine Dataset

# Motivation
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the most crucial part in data science, yet it is often overlook. Yes, algorithm is fun, but we need to look closely to our data in order to derive important insights 

Here, I have provided an example of EDA on a famous dataset: wine quality dataset. This dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. We can get essential information regarding our data prior to analysis
# Prerequisites
To view this project properly, you're recommended to have the latest versions of the followings:
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Reverse Geocoder](https://github.com/thampiman/reverse-geocoder)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

# Files
In this repo, there is only one file:
- winedataset.ipynb

The file contains all the code ran for the project and some notes. 

# Project Summary
Here we are trying to derive some insights from our dataset just by using EDA. We will try to answer the following questions:
-How does the data look?
-What kind of story that each of our data tells?
-What are other interesting relationships that can be derived from exploring the data?


# Summary
Some of the insights from EDA:
- Alcohol % has the strongest positive correlation with quality, citric acid has the strongest negative correlation
- Type and concentration of acid can impact quality of wine 
- Our data has skewness with the exception of pH and density
